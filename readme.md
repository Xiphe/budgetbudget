## Contributing

You're really welcome to submit Pull Requests and Issues.

Please keep in mind that i'm building this app in my free time and don't plan to
monetize it.  
That means all help is really welcome but it might take some time for me to
respond to issues or review PRs.

### Run the app in development mode

All of the following assume that you're working on a recent version of MacOS and
have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) installed.

Run the following in your terminal:

```sh
# check out the source-code
git clone git@github.com:Xiphe/budgetbudget.git
cd budgetbudget

# install dependencies
npm install

# start the app in development mode
npm start
